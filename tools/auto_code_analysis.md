# 🐍 Auto Code Analysis

> Execute Python code to perform any analysis, file operations, or data processing tasks — directly within Open WebUI.

<br>

## ✨ What It Does

**Auto Code Analysis** gives your Open WebUI assistant the ability to write and execute Python code. This allows it to perform complex calculations, analyze data, process files, and generate visualizations on the fly.

You get:

- 🐍 **Python Execution**: Run Python code securely in a sandboxed environment
- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Process and analyze data from files or conversation context
- 📈 **Visualizations**: Generate charts and graphs that are displayed directly in the chat
- 📁 **File Operations**: Read, write, and manipulate files
- 🛡️ **Sandboxed Environments**: Choose between self-hosted Jupyter or cloud-based E2B sandboxes

<br>

## 💾 How It Works

- **Code Generation**: The assistant writes Python code to solve your problem
- **Execution**: The code is executed in a secure sandbox (Jupyter or E2B)
- **Output Handling**: Standard output, errors, and results are captured and returned to the assistant
- **File Management**: Generated files (like charts) are automatically uploaded and displayed in the chat
