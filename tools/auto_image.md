## 🎨 Image Generation

Create images from scratch using text descriptions. The tool uses Open WebUI's configured image generation engine.

### Usage Pattern

Simply ask the assistant to create or generate an image:

```
"Create an image of a serene mountain landscape at sunset"
"Generate a futuristic city with flying cars"
"Make me a picture of a cute robot reading a book"
```

### Advanced Options

You can specify additional parameters:

- **Multiple Images**: "Generate 3 variations of..."
- **Custom Size**: "Create a 512x512 image of..."
- **Negative Prompts**: Tell the assistant what to avoid (e.g., "no people, no text")

### Example

```
User: Create a detailed image of a magical forest with glowing mushrooms and fireflies.
      Make it mystical and enchanting. Generate 2 variations.
Assistant: I'll create two mystical forest images for you.
```

**What happens:**

1. The assistant identifies the image generation request
2. Constructs a detailed prompt from your description
3. Calls the configured image engine with `n=2` for two variations
4. Streams status updates ("creating image...")
5. Displays both generated images in the chat

## ✏️ Image Editing

Modify existing images in your conversation using natural language prompts.

### Usage Pattern

Upload or paste an image into the chat, then ask for modifications:

```
"Edit this image to add a starry night sky"
"Change the colors to warm autumn tones"
"Remove the background and make it transparent"
"Add more detail to the foreground"
```

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Image Detection**: The tool scans your conversation for images
2. **Smart Indexing**: Uses the most recent image by default, or you can specify which one
3. **Context-Aware Editing**: Preserves the original image structure while applying your changes

### Image Selection

- **Most Recent** (default): Automatically uses the last image in the conversation
- **Specific Image**: The assistant can reference earlier images when needed
- **Multiple Sources**: Works with both uploaded files and inline images

### Example

```
User: [uploads image of a beach scene]
      Edit this to make it look like sunset with dramatic clouds
Assistant: I'll edit your beach image to add sunset and dramatic clouds.
            [Edited image appears in chat]
```

## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

### Writing Good Prompts

- **Be Specific**: Include details about style, mood, colors, and composition
- **Use Descriptive Language**: "dramatic lighting" > "nice lighting"
- **Mention Medium**: "oil painting", "photograph", "digital art", "watercolor"
- **Include Context**: Time of day, weather, atmosphere, perspective

### Effective Negative Prompts

Use negative prompts to avoid common issues:

- Quality problems: "blurry, low quality, pixelated, distorted"
- Unwanted elements: "text, watermark, people, animals"
- Style constraints: "cartoon, anime, 3D render" (if you want photorealism)

### Size Recommendations

- **1024x1024**: Best for general use, square images
- **512x512**: Faster generation, smaller files
- **1024x768** or **768x1024**: Landscape or portrait orientations
- Check your image engine's supported sizes for optimal results

## 🛟 Troubleshooting

### No Images Generated

- Verify that an image generation engine is configured in Open WebUI (Settings → Images)
- Check that the engine is running and accessible
- Review image engine logs for specific error messages

### Image Editing Not Working

- Make sure `CHECK_CHAT_FILES` is enabled if using chat-level attachments
- Verify that the image is visible in the conversation
- Try explicitly mentioning "edit the image I just uploaded"
- Check that your image engine supports editing (not all do)

### Poor Quality Results

- Provide more detailed, specific prompts
- Adjust `IMAGE_STEPS` if supported by your engine
- Try adding negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements
- Experiment with different sizes and aspect ratios

### Tool Not Appearing in Chat

- Ensure the extension is enabled in your chat settings
- Check that Open WebUI version is 0.6.0 or newer
- Verify the tool is not disabled in user or admin settings
