# Auto Claude

> Clean, plug-and-play Claude manifold pipeline with support for all the latest features from Anthropic.

<br>

## ✨ What It Does

**Auto Claude** provides seamless integration with Anthropic's Claude models in Open WebUI, supporting advanced features like:

- **Extended Thinking**: Enable Claude's reasoning capabilities with configurable budget tokens
- **Vision Support**: Process images and PDFs in your conversations
- **Tool Calling**: Full support for function calling with automatic execution loops
- **Multiple Model Variants**: Access to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1, and Haiku 4.5
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time streaming with proper tool call handling

You get:

- Production-ready Claude integration with minimal setup
- Native support for both Anthropic and OpenAI SDK patterns
- Automatic tool execution without manual intervention
- Seamless multimodal conversations

<br>

## 💾 How It Works

- **Manifold Pipeline**: Exposes multiple Claude models through a single pipeline
- **Smart Token Management**: Automatically calculates and validates token budgets for extended thinking
- **Tool Execution Loop**: Handles multi-turn tool calling automatically
- **Format Conversion**: Seamlessly converts between OpenAI and Anthropic message formats
- **Multimodal Processing**: Validates and processes images and PDFs with size limits

## 🚀 Installation

1. Make sure your Open WebUI is version `0.5.0` or newer
2. Click on _GET_ to add the extension to your Open WebUI deployment
3. Add your Anthropic API key to the configuration

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configure via the Open WebUI extension settings:

| Setting             | Description             | Default                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your Anthropic API key  | _(from environment variable)_ |
| `debug_mode`        | Enable detailed logging | `false`                       |

## 🤖 Available Models

All models released after Claude Sonnet 4 are available in both standard and extended thinking variants.

---

## 🧠 Extended Thinking

Enable Claude's reasoning capabilities by using `-thinking` model variants or setting the `reasoning_effort` parameter:

### Reasoning Effort Levels

| Level    | Budget Tokens | Use Case                         |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `none`   | 0             | Standard responses (no thinking) |
| `low`    | 4,000         | Quick reasoning tasks            |
| `medium` | 16,000        | Moderate complexity problems     |
| `high`   | 32,000        | Complex reasoning and analysis   |
| `max`    | 48,000        | Most difficult reasoning tasks   |

You can also specify custom budget tokens as an integer value.

**Token Limit**: Combined `budget_tokens` + `max_tokens` cannot exceed 128,000 tokens.

### Example

```python
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-thinking",
  "reasoning_effort": "high",
  "max_tokens": 8000
}
# This uses 32,000 thinking tokens + 8,000 output tokens = 40,000 total
```

## 🖼️ Multimodal Support

### Images

- **Supported formats**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Max size**: 5 MB
- **Methods**: Base64 data URIs or direct URLs

### PDFs

- **Max size**: 32 MB
- **Methods**: Base64 data URIs or direct URLs

Images and PDFs are automatically validated for size and format before processing.

## 🛠️ Tool Calling

Auto Claude supports full tool calling with automatic execution loops:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Recognizes when Claude requests tool use
2. **Execution**: Runs the tool with provided arguments
3. **Result Injection**: Sends results back to Claude
4. **Multi-turn Support**: Continues until task completion
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles tool execution failures

The pipeline handles both streaming and non-streaming tool calls seamlessly.

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Dual SDK Support

- **Anthropic SDK**: Native support for Anthropic's message format and features
- **OpenAI SDK**: Compatible with OpenAI-style requests for easier migration

### Smart Message Processing

- Automatically converts between message formats
- Handles tool results and tool use blocks
- Preserves conversation context across tool calls
